## Overview
Welcome to the **SportsSciSirens** Team! We are entering Women in Data Sports 2023 Hackathon. This will be our main place where we host our code and contributions and keep track of everything related to the hackahton.
Below is an excerpt on this years challenge.

```
This year, we're balling. Participants will work on projects featuring an NBA player tracking data set over a 
six-week virtual sprint period. During this time, they must build a functioning application prototype OR 
submit a data science project or notebook with recommendations geared towards a front office or coaching staff. 
Participants must use NBA tracking data provided by Sportradar, to develop their projects. Participants may 
also use any other publicly available data set to enhance their projects, such as biography data.

The Women in Sports Data hackathon is a project-based data competition open to women and non-binary 
individuals with no pre-existing employment in professional sports. Upon registering for the hackathon, 
they will be invited to join a Slack community, where they can meet fellow contestants and mentors, form teams, 
nd engage in related hackathon programming. 
The top three (3) projects will be invited to Philadelphia to present during the symposium and to compete 
for $10,000 in cash prizes.
